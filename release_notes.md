## Release Notes

### v3.1.2

**[New Features]**
- The process of loading proto files from disk respects logging verbosity levels.
- The offset of the consumed message can be optionally included in the output.
- Different time-based starting offsets can be defined for different partitions.
- Predefined starting offsets (eg. `oldest`, `newest`, `local`, etc) can be defined for individual partitions.
- The following new flags have been added to `consume` commands: 
    - `--to`: To define a stop offset/timestamp.
    - `--idle-timeout`: The amount of time the consumer will wait for a message to arrive before stop consuming from a partition.
    - `--exclusive`: Only explicitly defined partitions (Partition#Offset|Timestamp) will be consumed. The rest will be excluded.

**[Changes]**
 - `-U` (for SASL username) and `-P` (for SASL password) short flags have been removed.
 - `Partition` and `Key` metadata will be printed to the output as separate lines for non-json formats.
 - `UTC` suffix has been replaced with timezone offsets.
 - `--from` is now a repeatable flag instead of a single comma separated string.
 - Partition-Offset delimiter has been changed to `#` for `--from` and `--to` values.
 - Wildcard offset definition syntax (`:Offset`) has been replaced with `--exclusive` flag to reduce the complexity.
 - User will not be asked to provide `topic` (or proto `schema`) in the interactive mode, if it's already been provided via command arguments. 

**[Fixes]**
- Loading proto files from disk respects termination signals received from the OS (Ctrl + C).
