## Contribution and Feature Request

Trubka is built based on the problems I was trying to solve in my day to day work and I tried to build it as flexible as I could so that the community hopefully finds it useful too. That said, the tool by no means is compelete or issue free. I will openly accept PRs and feature requests to make sure we will have a better Trubka over time. 

Please feel free to play around with Trubka, log issues, open PRs and share your thoughts with the community and myself.

Thank you!
